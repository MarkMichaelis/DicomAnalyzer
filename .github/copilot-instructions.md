# Project — Copilot Workspace Instructions

## Project Overview

Project is a **PowerShell module** that interfaces with the Google Recorder gRPC-Web API at `recorder.google.com`. It provides cmdlets for authentication and recording management.

## Language Detection

Detect the project's primary language from its files and apply the matching guidance below. When multiple languages coexist, apply each language's rules to the files of that language.

| Indicator files | Language |
|---|---|
| `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1` | PowerShell |
| `.ts`, `.js`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript / JavaScript |
| `.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` | Python |
| `.cs`, `.csproj`, `.sln` | C# / .NET |
| `.go`, `go.mod` | Go |
| `.rs`, `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `.java`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` | Java |

If the language is not listed, infer conventions from the project's existing code, README, and build files.

## Development Philosophy

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** — Write tests first, always. No production code without a failing test.
2. **Systematic over ad-hoc** — Process over guessing. Follow structured workflows.
3. **Complexity reduction** — Simplicity as primary goal. YAGNI ruthlessly.
4. **Evidence over claims** — Verify before declaring success. Run commands, read output, present facts.
5. **Functional Testing** — Validate user-facing behavior with integration or end-to-end tests.
6. **Continuous Refactoring** — Eliminate duplication after every green step.

## Code Style — Generic (All Languages)

- Keep functions / methods small (≤ 20 lines) and single-purpose.
- Prefer immutable variables where the language supports them.
- Every public function must have a documentation comment (doc-comment, JSDoc, XML doc, comment-based help, etc.).
- Follow the language's established naming, formatting, and module conventions.
- Use the project's existing linter / formatter. Run it after every change.
- After **every step** (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR, or any code change), run the project's compile/lint command and verify there are no errors. Fix any errors before proceeding.

## Code Style — PowerShell

- All new source and test files must be `.ps1` / `.psm1` / `.psd1`.
- Follow the **Verb-Noun** naming convention for functions (`Get-GoogleRecording`, `Connect-GoogleRecorder`).
- Name files in **PascalCase** matching the function name (e.g., `Get-GoogleRecording.ps1`).
- Use **comment-based help** (`<# .SYNOPSIS ... #>`) for every exported function.
- Use `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` in scripts; prefer `-ErrorAction Stop` on individual calls.
- After every step, run `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` to check for lint issues and `Import-Module ... -Force` to verify the module loads:
  ```powershell
  Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path src/ -Recurse -Severity Warning
  Import-Module ./src/Project/Project.psd1 -Force -ErrorAction Stop
  ```
- Prefer `[CmdletBinding()]` and `param()` blocks for all functions.
- Use **approved verbs** only (`Get-Verb` to list them).

## Code Style — TypeScript / JavaScript

- Favor TypeScript (`.ts`) over JavaScript (`.js`).
- After every step, run `npx tsc` to verify there are no type errors.
- Prefer `const` / `let`; never `var`.
- Use ES modules (`import` / `export`).
- Name files in kebab-case; classes in PascalCase; functions/variables in camelCase.
- Every public function must have a JSDoc comment.

## Testing Conventions — Generic

- **Unit tests** mirror the source tree.
- **Test files live in a `tests/` directory** (or the language's conventional location).
- Use the project's established test framework. If none exists, choose the community standard for the language.
- Functional / integration tests are organized by feature or user flow.

## Testing Conventions — PowerShell

| Layer | Tool | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | Pester | `tests/unit/**/*.Tests.ps1` |
| Integration tests | Pester | `tests/integration/**/*.Tests.ps1` |

- Unit test files mirror the source tree (e.g., `src/Project/Public/Get-GoogleRecording.ps1` → `tests/unit/Public/Get-GoogleRecording.Tests.ps1`).
- Run tests with:
  ```powershell
  Invoke-Pester -Path tests/ -Output Detailed
  ```
- Mock external dependencies with Pester's `Mock` command. Use real code paths wherever possible.

## Testing Conventions — TypeScript / JavaScript

| Layer | Tool | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | Vitest | `tests/unit/**/*.test.ts` |
| Functional / E2E | Playwright | `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts` |

- Run tests with:
  ```bash
  npx tsc && npx vitest run
  npx playwright test
  ```

## Test Data — Live API

A recording named **"Test Test Test"** exists in the connected Google Recorder account and is reserved for testing.

- **Use only this recording** for any integration or functional test that touches the live API (rename, download, metadata changes, etc.).
- **Do not modify, delete, or rename any other recording** during testing.
- **Restore original state** after each test — e.g., if you rename the recording, rename it back to "Test Test Test" when done.

## Product Specification

Maintain a living product specification in `docs/product-spec.md`.

- **Update the spec with every feature** — when a new behavior is implemented, document it in the spec.
- **When a requirement changes, update the spec to reflect the final behavior** — do not keep outdated requirements. The spec always describes the current state of the product, not its history.
- **Replace superseded acceptance criteria** — if a feature's behavior is modified, rewrite the acceptance criteria to match the new behavior. Remove or revise any criteria that no longer apply.
- The spec is the single source of truth for what the application **currently** does.
- Sections: Overview, Features (with acceptance criteria), API Surface, UI Flows, Data Model, Known Limitations.
- Use Conventional Commits for spec changes: `docs(spec): add <feature> specification` or `docs(spec): update <feature> specification`.

## Git Worktrees

When creating git worktrees, always place them inside the repo root under a `.worktrees/` subdirectory:

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/<branch-name> <branch-name>
```

Never create worktrees as siblings of the repo root folder. (Doing so forces the agent to prompt to access the files since they are outside the scope of the session.)

Also make sure your `.gitignore` has:

```gitignore
/.worktrees/
```

## Branching Strategy

- **Never commit directly to `main`.** Always create a feature branch first.
- Branch naming: `<agent-name>/<type>/<short-description>` — prefix with the agent/model name.
  Examples: `Opus.4.6/feat/audio-playback`, `Opus.4.6/fix/transcript-encoding`.
- All work happens on the feature branch. Merge to `main` only via pull request after the dev loop passes.

## Commit Messages

Follow Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`.

## Agent Files

Dedicated agent prompts live in `.github/agents/` using the `.agent.md` format:

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `brainstorming.agent.md` | Socratic design refinement — explore intent, propose approaches, get approval before coding |
| `tdd.agent.md` | Red → Green → Refactor cycle with Iron Law enforcement (no code without failing test) |
| `functional-testing.agent.md` | Generate & maintain functional / E2E tests with verification-before-completion |
| `refactor.agent.md` | Identify and remove duplication after each green step — YAGNI, simplicity first |
| `code-review.agent.md` | Independent code review prompt & checklist — invoked via cross-model CLI (codex, claude, copilot) for severity-based findings |
| `systematic-debugging.agent.md` | 4-phase root cause investigation — no fixes without understanding the problem first |
| `dev-loop.agent.md` | Orchestrator: Brainstorm → Plan → TDD → Refactor → Functional Test → Verify → Cross-Model Review → Fix → Repeat |

### Development Workflow

Use `@dev-loop` to drive the full quality cycle for any feature. It coordinates
all other agents in order and repeats until the code review passes cleanly.

```
Brainstorm → Plan → TDD (Red→Green) → Refactor → Functional Test → Verify → Code Review (cross-model CLI) → Fix → Re-Review
```

Use `@brainstorming` when exploring a new idea before committing to implementation.
Use `@systematic-debugging` when encountering any bug or unexpected behavior.
