\# Requirements for DICOM Analysis Application





\- Views DICOM files (ultrasound)

\- Allows for drawing multiple "Region of Interest (ROI)." It will be necessary to use the same ROI across multiple frames and multiple files.

\- Allow for undo (Ctrl+z) when re-drawing ROIs

\- Enable support for free-form or oval/circle ROI.

\- Has support for highly accurate ultrasound-related "Pixel Intensity." 

\- Allows for export of data (like pixel intensity) to Microsoft Excel files and provides significant Excel interaction, like pivot tables and drawing graphs.

\- Allows for import or reading a directory of DICOM files, which can potentially be large.

\- Support motion compensation (aligning the images) between frames and files when the patient moves.

\- Create a maximum intensity projection (MIP) that tracks pixels across frames and uses the maximum intensity for that pixel to create a single MIP in frames that come later.

\- Support parametric imaging

\- Support respiratory gating.
